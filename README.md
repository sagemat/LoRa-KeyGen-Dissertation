LoRa Key Generation (Dissertation)

End-to-end key generation over LoRa/LPWAN for constrained devices.
Pipeline: RSSI sampling â†’ quantization â†’ custom packet matching (no ACK) â†’ information reconciliation (BCH-inspired) â†’ SHA-256.

Highlights

Packet matching without ACK: keep Alice/Bob vectors aligned using receiver packet counts.

Robust reconciliation: simple, BCH-inspired method to correct bit mismatches before hashing.

Real-world tests: multi-floor lab runs & elevator scenario; synchronized counts and matching final hashes.

Constraints explicit: ~3 minutes time-to-key under low-power assumptions.

Why it matters

LoRa links are low-power and narrow-band. This design favors clarity under constraints: minimal protocol surface, measurable timing/energy, and a practical route to secure pairing in hostile RF conditions.
